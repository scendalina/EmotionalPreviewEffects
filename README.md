Emotional Parafoveal Preview Effects: Positivity Effect in Reading & Cognitive Aging
Dissertation Project Repository

Overview
Welcome to the official repository for my doctoral research, which investigates how emotional content in language—specifically, emotional words presented just outside the central focus of vision (the parafovea)—influences reading and cognitive processing across the adult lifespan.

Project Summary:
This work explores the remarkable ability of the visual system to detect and process emotional words before we consciously fixate on them. Using the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975), I manipulated the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) of words presented parafoveally during sentence reading. This paradigm allowed for seamless, covert changes to words as readers’ eyes crossed invisible boundaries, ensuring participants were unaware of the manipulation. The big question: Do emotional words grab your attention and help you read faster—even before you consciously see them?

What Did I Find?:
Emotional Preview Benefit: Emotional words in the parafovea consistently drew attention and facilitated faster reading of subsequent words, even when the previewed word did not match the target word—a phenomenon known as the semantic preview effect. Previous studies had not attributed this effect to emotional valence under such rigorous, naturalistic conditions.

Age-related Differences in Emotional Sensitivity: Age matters! I tested two groups:

Younger Adults (N=30, ages 18–35): Showed unique reading benefits from negative parafoveal words, but not from positive or neutral words.
Older Adults (N=30, ages 60–85): Demonstrated the opposite pattern, with significant benefits from positive parafoveal words, and no benefit from negative or neutral words.

What does this mean? / What is the Greater Theoretical Context & Potential for Impact::
These results align with the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (Carstensen et al., 2003; Carstensen et al., 1999), a dominant theory in the realm of cognitive aging + affective cognition, which posits that as people age and perceive their time horizons as shorter, they prioritize emotionally meaningful and positive information to enhance well-being and goal attainment. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate both emotional preview effects and an age-related positivity effect in reading—extending findings previously limited to faces, images, or isolated word presentations.

TLDR::: This fits with the idea from Socioemotional Selectivity Theory—as we get older and our time horizons shrink, we start to focus more on positive, meaningful stuff.

Why Is This Cool?
First time anyone’s shown both emotional preview effects and an age-related positivity effect in actual reading (not just with faces or isolated words).
